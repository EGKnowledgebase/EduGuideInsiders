<h1>SMS Notifications Feature</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently in the process of testing a new feature which will allow our members to receive notifications of new comments in the Paths and on their personal dashboards via text message. All members would be able to enable mobile notifications from their My Settings area, but students who qualify will be prompted to signed up as they go through their paths.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am seeking a few volunteers who might be interested in helping us to test this feature. You would need to supply a mobile phone number. Any costs for the SMS messages would be your responsibility.</p>
<h2>Feature Behavior</h2>
<p>In this first version of SMS notifications, members will be able to receive the notifications but they won’t be able to respond. The text message includes alert text and an attached link which will direct the recipient directly into the comment thread within the site.</p>
<h2>Testing Scope</h2>
<p>I would be interested in hearing feedback on the process for signing up for the mobile notifications, the process of receiving the alerts and responding to the comment on the site, as well as any bugs you encounter while testing.</p>
