<h1>Live Support available via Chat</h1>
<p>If you have a question, run into an issue, or have a suggestion for improving the site, you can now chat with an EduGuide staff member live during business hours.</p>
<p>Click on the link labeled “Chat with Us” inside the main navigation to open up the chat window. This link is also available inside the side menu on the Path, group management, Members, and Coaches pages.</p>
<p>The link will only appear when someone is available for chat requests. We typically try to be online for most of the day. You can still get in touch 24-7  via the “Help” located on your team’s dashboard, or by sending email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try the next time that you’re online.</p>
