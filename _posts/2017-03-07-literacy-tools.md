Students are able to easily access a new set of tools that can help them understand terminology used inside the EduGuide Path. Highlighting a word will display a definition of that word, and will automatically save the word inside a personal glossary which can be accessed by selecting My Glossary from the upper left menu . Students can also translate words into different languages, or hear the word pronounced aloud.
<h1>Defining a word</h1>
Display the dictionary overlay by first highlighting any word in the path. This can be displayed in the blue box, or posted as a user comment. Students can also define words as they are writing responses to a step question.

<h1>Translations</h1>
There are two buttons along the top of the dictionary overlay. Clicking on the arrow next to the language translator will open up a list of other languages which are available for translation. When you select a different language, the word equivalent for that language will be shown.

<h1>Viewing multiple words or phrase</h1>
When you highlight more than one word, the words or phrase will appear in the overlay. Click on a specific word in order to see its definition.

<h1>Viewing your Glossary</h1>
You can view your glossary from the Path Menu by clicking on the 3 gray lines in the upper left corner. While you’re working on your path, open up the sidebar and then click “My Glossary.” You will be taken to a page listing all of the words that you’ve looked up while working on your path.

You can remove words from the glossary by clicking on the “x” located to the far right side.
