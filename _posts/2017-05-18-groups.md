<h1><b>Groups</b></h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Groups can be used to organize a team by dividing up members based on association, function, skill level, etc. For example, members of the team could be split up into separate project teams, classrooms, or grade levels. There is no limit to the number of groups which can be created within a team, nor for how many groups a member can belong to.</p>
<p>The groups are also used in the filters for the team. When you are viewing the team dashboard, member management, the group management page, or the metrics page, you will be able to filter the view based on the groups that members belong to. This makes it easier to locate members, follow discussions, or track path progress.</p>
<p>Each group is also assigned a join code and a unique web address. When you're adding new members to your team, you can give them the join code and instruct them to enter it as they are registering on the site. Group join codes permit new members to join the site, but also automatically approves them for membership with your team and assigns them to the appropriate group.</p>
<p>You can also track a group’s progress in the paths by following it. You can follow or unfollow a group from its detail page within the Group Management section inside the team.</p>

<h3>Creating Groups</h3>
<p>To create a new group, you would enter a group name into the “New Group Name” field, and then click “Add New Group.” The group will appear in the list on the left hand side of the page.</p>
<h3>Viewing a Group’s details</h3>
<p>You can add or remove group members, view join code information, or follow a group from each group’s detail page. To view a group’s detail page, click on the group’s name in the sidebar on the left hand side of the page.</p>
<h4>Adding Members to a group</h4>

<p>Click on “Show non-Group members” along the top of the page. The view will change so that you are now seeing team members who are not members of this group. Add members to the group by clicking on the green “Add” button which is shown to the right of each person’s name. When you’re done, click “Show Group Members” to see a list of the persons who are now members of this group.</p>
<h4>Removing Members from a Group</h4>

<p>To remove members, click on the orange “Remove from group” button which is shown to the right of each group member. </p>
<h4>Following Groups</h4>
<p>Follow a group by viewing a group’s detail page, and then clicking “Follow group.” When you follow a group, it will appear in your list of filters on the metrics page, and you will receive daily and weekly progress reports updating you on the progress being made by those groups. If you would like to stop following a group, you can click “Unfollow Group.”</p>
<h4>Changing a Group’s Name</h4>
<p>Edit a group’s name in the detail page  by clicking on the pencil icon that is displayed next to it. Once you are satisfied with the change, click “save.”</p>
<h5>Group Codes</h5>
<p>Each group has been assigned a join code and web address which allow new members to automatically join that group when they join the team. When you are inviting someone to join your team, you can supply them with either the join code or the unique web address. If they use the join code, they will need to go to <a href="http://join.eduguide.org">http://join.eduguide.org</a> and then enter the code with their registration information. If they use the join web address, they will be taken to a registration page with the join code already filled in.</p>
<h4>Deleting the Group</h4>
<p>Click on the group name that you want to delete, and then click “Delete group” found on the right side of the screen. You can delete a group at any time, but keep in mind that <b>you cannot undo a deletion once you’ve confirmed the change</b>.  </p>
<h4>Auto Group</h4>
<p>You can also enable or disable your team’s auto group feature from the group management page. When enabled, new groups will automatically be created for new team coaches as they join the team, and labeled with their name. For example, if John Smith joins your team with autogroup turned on, the group “John Smith” would be created automatically.</p>
