<p>In this exercise, I’m asking you to take a look at a rough draft for our homepage and then respond with feedback. Answer the following questions:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>What are your overall impresions?</li>
<li>What works best on the page?</li>
<li>What are two things that you would change?</li>
<li>Based on the information given on the homepage, would you sign up for our platform? Give reasons why or why not.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Send your reactions or general feedback to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@eduguide.org">helpdesk@eduguide.org</a>. The link for the homepage is shared in the card on Trello.</p>
