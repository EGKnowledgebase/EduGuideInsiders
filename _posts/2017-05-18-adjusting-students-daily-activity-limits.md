<h1>Adjusting students’ daily activity limits</h1>
<p></p>
<p>By default, students are allowed to complete one new activity per day. This helps to encourage reflection as they read the information in an activity and respond to the questions. However, there is a way to adjust a student’s account so that they are able to complete more than one activity per day.</p>
<p>From the Metrics page, locate the student whose account you would like to adjust. Click on the three vertical dots to the far right of their name, and then click on “Edit Membership.” You will be taken to their team membership page.</p>
<h2>[Metrics Page Screenshot]</h2>
<p>Locate the header “Path Settings,” and the field labeled “Activities/Day.” You can increase or lower this limit by entering in a numerical value. When you’re done editing their daily activity limit, click “Save.”</p>
<h2>[Edit Membership Page Screenshot]</h2>
<p>Once the settings are saved, they will be applied to the student the next time that they log into their account.</p>
