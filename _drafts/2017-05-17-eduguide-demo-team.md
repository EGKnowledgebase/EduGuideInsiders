<h1>EduGuide Demo Team</h1>
The EduGuide Demo Team is a single team which is offered to potential partners who are interested in the platform, but want to test it out before they sign up. Visitors can join the demo team by clicking on one of the two buttons which are displayed on the homepage. From that point forward, they are prompted to either log into an existing account, or to start a new account by entering in their registration information. Upon joining the site/team, they are routed into the first page in their path.

On the backend, a process is followed which is unique from the onboarding for the typical team. When users join the Demo Team, they are designated as both a restricted member, a designation reserved for student members, and they are given the status of demo user. Being a demo user applies some additional limitations on their account which are not given to other members on the site. This additional designation also allows us to add existing members to the Demo Team.

For the most part, members of the Demo Team are given the student experience. They can access their personal profile, settings, and the path. They are also subject to the daily activity throttle, which is 1 activity per day, and as a part of the configuration for the Demo Team their subscriptions are limited to just five activities. Demo Team members are subscribed to the Demo Path, which contains custom information designed to introduce them to the path system.

As Demo Team users, these members are also subjected to a few additional limitations and special functions. They will be shown a reminder bar along the top of the screen on every page in the site prompting them to purchase a full version of the platform. They will also be sent a series of notifications reminding them to work on their path, ask questions, or to contact EduGuide if they are ready to purchase the platform.

They are also subject to a demo period. After this period ends, they will lose access to the path.
<h2>Transitioning Users</h2>
There is already a rule on the site which changes restricted members to full members if they become coaches. However, when members of the Demo Team are added or invited to join a partner team, this restriction is not listed. There is no automation built in for removing the demo user status from an account. These changes are made manually by EG Staff. On occasion, a member will join a partner team but find that they have limited access to the tools on the site. This is typically due to their previous membership on the Demo Team, and requires manual adjustments.
<h2>Path Subscriptions</h2>
When a user joins a team, they pick up the team’s set of path settings. If paths are enabled for the team, then that user will become subscribed to that path. If paths are disabled, then they will no longer be subscribed to any path. Other configurations that can impact users as they are joining a team are Path Title, daily activity throttle, minimum word count configuration, and path subscription.
