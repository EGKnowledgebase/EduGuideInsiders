<p>Students are able to easily access a new set of tools that can help them understand terminology used inside the EduGuide Path. Highlighting a word will display a definition of that word, and will automatically save the word inside a personal glossary which can be accessed by selecting My Glossary from the upper left menu . Students can also translate words into different languages., or hear the word pronounced aloud. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Defining a word</h1>
<p>Display the dictionary overlay by first highlighting any word in the path. This can be displayed in the blue box, or posted as a user comment. Students can also define words as they are writing responses to a step question.</p>

<h1>Translations</h1>
<p>There are two buttons along the top of the dictionary overlay. Clicking on the arrow next to the language translator will open up a list of other languages which are available for translation. When you select a different language, the word equivalent for that language will be shown.</p>
