<h1>Using the View all Replies Feature</h1>
<p></p>
<p>There is a new feature in the path metrics page which allows coaches to quickly review all of the responses that students have posted for a specific activity step in the path. Coaches can zoom in on a specific step question, respond to students’ posts, and adjust the view so that they are seeing posted comments from students in different groups.</p>
<h1>Viewing All Replies</h1>
<p>If you’re not there yet, you will want to begin by first navigating to the Metrics page. Click on the menu control next to the EduGuide logo and then choose “Metrics,” or use the side menu to navigate to the Metrics page.</p>

<p>Next, look for the hyperlinked phrase “View all replies.” These will appear at the end of the text for any step that asks a question or expected a posted response from all the students who belong to groups that you follow.</p>

<h2>Posting comments</h2>

<h2>Adjusting the Group Filter</h2>
<p>You can view a list of other students’ responses to the step by adjusting the group filter shown towards the top of the page. Click on the dropdown menu, and then select a different group to change the view. The page will refresh, and then show posts for only the students who belong to the group you chose.</p>
