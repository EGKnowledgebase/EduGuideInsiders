<h1>Daily Activity Limit</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Daily Activity Limit is the number of activities that students can begin in the path within a 24 hour period. Coaches can set this limit for students in their Edit Membership pages, from either the Metrics Page or from the Members page within the Groups Tool.</p>
<p>This limits only the number of activities which can be started within a given day. If a student returns to the path and is in the middle of an activity, then they can complete it and then start additional activities during that same session, depending on what their limit is set to.</p>
<p>By default, students are limited to one new activity per day. This is designed to encourage students to focus on the information presented in each activity and to reflect upon their responses to questions.</p>
